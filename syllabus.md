# CS 447 Syllabus

## Description

Go [here](/about) for the course description.

## Grades

* **20%** Labs (Around one a week, only ten count (I think it will be 12 labs))
* **30%** Projects (Two projects: 15% each; One MIPS, One Logisim)
* **15%** Midterm One
* **15%** Midterm Two
* **20%** Final (semi-cumulative)

## Textbook

Computer Organization and Design - The Hardware/Software Interface, John Hennessy and David Patterson, FIFTH EDITION, Morgan Kaufmann.

I don't really care about the book as far as teaching the concepts, and I'll say that the book is not *actually* required and is more of a supplemental material for furthering your understanding and knowledge.

As always, you can find this textbook in most libraries and definitely will be reserved in Hillman.

## Exams

## Labs

## Projects

There will be two projects for this course.
One will be a programming project requiring the writing of a significant assembly program.
The target will be between 100 and 300 lines of code, maybe a little more or a little less depending on your design or the requirements.
The programming, including labs, will be using the MIPS simulator.

The projects will be graded on a rubric by your TA or class grader.
The rubric will reflect the posted requirements and goal of the project.
Partial credit will be rewarded based on the rubric and the overall requirements of the project.

Solutions will not be provided for any project.

You are responsible for attending lectures and recitations in order to receive any guidance or hints given generally to the class (even if they do not get posted)

TAs and myself will be available during posted office hours (and by request, otherwise) to provide assistance.

## Attendance

You should come to class!
First off, I make sure to explore the relevance of assembly and computer architectures in everyday life.
The exploration of the algorithms and techniques is fairly vital for success on exams and projects.
Also, I think I'm a good teacher (you can disagree in the OMETs, which you need to attend class to participate in!)

## Collaboration

Generally speaking, as part of the overall university policy and culture, collaboration is **not allowed** in any form or any project or exam, unless otherwise noted.

This includes the sharing of materials, past materials, materials from other sections of this class. The only exception is if **you** wrote the material (because you are repeating the class).

You are generally allowed to talk about projects and share insight (and you should!) You cannot write any part of another student's assignment or review another student's logic design.

## Late/Early Policy

* **Illness and other compelling reasons**: A late assignment (exam or project) with a valid excuse according to University rules, such as an extended illness or hospitalization, will be accepted up to one week late without a penalty. Arrangements must be made in advance when possible; written documentation of the compelling reason must be provided.

* **Voluntary late projects**: A project may be turned in late for any reason, but it will be penalized by 20% for each day it is late.

* **Voluntary late labs**: Because there are more labs than will be graded, and therefore the occassional missed lab can be missed without penalty, voluntary late labs will not be accepted.

* There will be no early exams. Make up exams must be pre-approved. No make up exams will be given that do not meet University rules and have proper (written) documentation.

* All make up work (exams, projects) must be completed within one week of the original assignment.

* Under extraordinary circumstances, such as an extended multi-week illness, other accommodations can be made for the course and this policy can be amended to permit some flexibility for completing the missed work.

## Notes for Students

If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact the [Office of Disability Resources and Services](https://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/drs/), 140 William Pitt Union (412-648-7890), as soon as possible in the term. They will verify your disability and determine reasonable accommodations for this course.
