*clarifications*: The program for B.2 will output a single number. You will simply replace the original integer with the one in B.2;
B.1 has been written to explain that the `1` refers to the syscall number.

## Part A: Numbers: There and back again

It is often useful to convert numbers to and from different bases.
In our role as programmers, base-2 (binary) is a very typical base to deal with considering computers generally speak it.
Hexadecimal, by virtue of it being a base that is a power-of-two, is often a useful way to represent binary information so it is easier to read and skim.

Generally, it is easier to convert binary to hexadecimal and also converting binary to decimal.
Take this into account as you proceed and remember the process of converting binary to hexadecimal we looked at in class.
The process works very well in reverse (hex to binary) as well!

And, of course, check your answers with a calculator, because we should fully understand that in no real-world situation would we actually do this by hand.
At the end of the day, the practice is useful for eventually memorizing the first 8 or 10 powers-of-two.
Beyond that, yeesh! Either a program would do it for us or we would use actually just use a calculator.

## Part B: MIPS: A Journey to Mars

Now, we will familiarize ourselves with MARS, our MIPS simulator.
We will be using this software for most of the course to write our assembly programs.
It is a very useful tool!
It lets us write assembly and programs that technically run directly on a CPU without needing the actual hardware.
Instead, MARS simulates the CPU as a program.
It is very cool that a computer as a general concept is so flexible that you can write a program that simulates a different computer.

First, you should grab MARS from the course website [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources).
You'll want to follow the instructions there, download and install Java if you need to, etc.
When you have your environment set up, you can run MARS by executing the `Mars_2191_a.jar` file directly.
You'll see an initial screen like so:

![The initial mars screen with an editor to the left and a list of registers and coprocessors to the right]({{site.baseurl}}/labs/01/mars_initial.png)

If the editor (on the left) is too small, you can click and drag the bar in between the left and right pane to make the editor bigger.

### A new file

The first thing you might do, and this will come to no surprise, is to create a new file!

Go to **File** > **New** (or click the new button on the toolbar) to create an empty assembly file.
The initial filename will be something like `mips1.asm` which just will not do.
Go ahead and simply save the file so you can give it a better name... your own name.
For this lab, you should name it `dww9_lab1.asm` but with your own pitt username instead of my pitt username.
Please do not use my name!
*I don't even use my own name!!*

### Comments about comments

The first thing we will learn for MIPS is how to write comments.
Like Java, and most high-level programming languages, assembly typically allows comments.
For MIPS, the comments will be anything following a `#` symbol.

```mips
# wilkie (dww9)
```

**Now, write your own name and username on the first line of your program.**

It is fairly good practice to keep up with commenting your code.
Sometimes it is nice, particularly as you start your assembly journey, to add comments that describe in a more familiar language (Java, etc) what you want your code to do.
Assembly is a very matter-of-fact way of expressing code; it really is a very direct and low-level way of telling a computer what to do.
Code comments help add a bit of humanity to your code... and ultimately helps you (and your very human instructor!) remember what you were trying to do.

### Main

Much like Java, your MIPS programs need a place to start, and that starting point (called an **entry point**) is the `main` function.
We define this by using this syntax:

```mips
.globl main
main:
```

`main:` is a **label**.
Labels name sections of your code.
They are like tabs in a book; they help us quickly jump to different parts of our program.
Later on, we will use labels to define functions and help us write loops and add structure to our programs.

For right now, however, the `main` label is a bit special.
It simply describes the first instruction to run in the program.
The rest of the instructions are executed from that point to the bottom of the program, unless redirected.
We will learn about a few different methods of jumping around our code very soon.

### Programmers... ASSEMBLE!!!

**Now we can assemble our program!**
We have essentially the smallest program we could write: an empty program.
So, we first need to **assemble** our program (we say assemble as opposed to *compile* in this context.)
You can go to **Run** > **Assemble**, or click the assemble button in the toolbar.
Or press **F3**.
See below for reference:

![The assemble button is highlighted]({{ site.baseurl }}/labs/01/mars_assemble.png)

Once we have assembled our program, it will automatically switch to the *Execute* tab.
You can get back to the editor by clicking on "Edit", but for now stay on the Execute tab.
You'll see a few windows.

* **Text Segment**: Shows the program itself. It shows it as the CPU sees it, which means pseudo-instructions are expanded to their actual instructions (more on this later!)
* **Labels**: Shows the memory addresses of each defined label in your program. This lets you quickly navigate to certain functions, which is useful when your programs get more complex.
* **Data Segment**: Shows the memory of the computer. You can inspect and even change memory values while your program is running!

Right now, we have an empty program.
Therefore, the **Text Segment** is empty.

**Let's run our program!**
To run our program, you can go to **Run** > **Go**, but you'll probably find it easier to just press the green run button shown below:

![The run button is highlighted]({{ site.baseurl }}/labs/01/mars_run.png)

Once you press the run button... the program will start... and then immediately end!
It *is* empty, after all.
Let's put some stuff in there.

### Hello... numbers.

Here it is.
What you've been waiting for!
Assembly code!

Go back to the editor by clicking the "Edit" tab, if you haven't already.
Type (**TYPE**; don't copy and paste it) after your `main:` line:

```mips
  li      a0, 1234
  li      v0, 1
  syscall
```

If you **save** and assemble again, you'll see the following:

![The text section now contains some code]({{ site.baseurl }}/labs/01/mars_run_hello.png)

And when you run:

![The run IO section now contains the number 1234]({{ site.baseurl }}/labs/01/mars_run_hello2.png)

You'll see that the program output the number `1234` to the Run I/O section.
If you cannot see your Run I/O tab, make sure you click on the up and down arrows that are circled above.
This should reveal this bottom panel.

So, what is going on in this program?

The `li` instruction is the **load immediate** pseudo-instruction, which we have seen (or will see) in the first assembly lecture.
It loads a value directly (immediately) into a *register*.
In the case of `li a0, 1234`, it loads the base-10 value `1234` into the register `a0`.
There is a convention here. The `a0` register is an **argument register**.
Whenever we see this, we know (by convention) that the register is to be used for specifying some argument to a function call of some kind.

### Syscalls

In this particular case, we are invoking a **system call**.
These are helpful higher-level actions that are, thankfully, implemented for us that we can just use!
Think of them as a helpful standard library or API.

MARS implements quite a few system calls.
You can see a list of them by going to **Help** > **Help** (or pressing **F1**) and clicking on "Syscalls" on the right side of the window.
This will tell you what the syscalls are, which ones are available, and how to use them.

If you look at the code we are using, `v0` is set to `1`.

{:.question}
| **B.1: Which syscall is being used when `v0` is 1?**

{:.question}
| **B.2: Update your program to output the hexadecimal number 0x4321 in base-10 in place of the "1234"**

### Collaboration Policy

You **may** work with one other person on your lab.
They may be from the other recitation, but must be from my CS447 lecture section.
You both must add a note to your written submission (at the top, very legibly) indicating who you are working with.
You both must submit your own individual lab submission, but may collaborate directly on the answer.

### Submission

Create a text file or Word document for your answers to questions A.1 and B.1.
Give it the file name `dww9_lab1.txt` or `dww9_lab1.docx` depending on the type of file and using **your own pitt username**.

Also save your assembly file after making the appropriate changes for B.2 and ensure it has a filename such as `dww9_lab1.asm` using **your own pitt username**.

Put both files into a `.zip` file with the name `dww9_lab1.zip`, again using your own pitt username (you'd be surprised) and submit to the `cs447-submissions` Box folder I have shared with you.
Your Box folder (you have 50GB!) is accessible through <http://my.pitt.edu>.
When you see your file within the shared folder, you know you have uploaded it successfully.
If you would like to resubmit, you can copy the file in again or append a number to your filename such as `dww9_lab1_2.zip`.
Let me know immediately if there are any problems submitting your work.
