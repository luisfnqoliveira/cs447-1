## Part A: Adding numbers (4 pts)

To help your practice, consider working each problem in pen or pencil (as you will do them in an exam environment). Then submit the results in a text document named `dww9_lab7a.txt/docx` but with your own pitt username.

**For each of the following subtractions, convert the numbers into 8-bit two’s-complement, add those and convert the resultant binary two’s-complement number in-to decimal form. Practice by showing all your work.**

## Part B: Let’s Build an Adder (4 pts)

Let’s consider building a one-bit adder. Recall that a one-bit adder has three inputs: the first one-bit “number” you are adding, the second one-bit “number” you are adding, and a carry-in bit. There are two outputs: the answer (result of the addition) and the carry-out bit. Several one-bit adders can be joined together to build an n-bit adder (where n is as large as desired).

### Logisim

Start by grabbing Logisim from the course website [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources).
You'll want to follow the instructions there, download and install Java if you need to, etc..
When you have your environment set up, you can run Logisim by executing the `logisim-2.7.2-2191_a.jar` file directly.
You'll see an initial screen like so:

![The initial Logisim screen with ...]({{site.baseurl}}/labs/07/logisim_initial.png)

Start Logisim and create a new circuit. Save this file as `dww9_lab7b.circ` but with your own pitt username. In this file, you will create a one-bit adder, but first let’s learn a bit about Logisim.

### Tools

![Logisim tools]({{site.baseurl}}/labs/07/tools.png)

In the toolbar above:
 * The poke tool (the hand icon) lets you change the values of input pins to test different inputs.
 * The arrow tool lets you add, select, and manipulate wires.
   - You can “undraw” wires (you have to do it to understand it :) to shorten them
   - Or use the delete key to remove the selected wire
 * The "A" tool allows you to place labels in your circuits.
 * Square boxes are **input pins**. Their values are being used to compute a value.
 * Circle boxes are **output pins**. Their values are being computed by the circuit and output to circuitry that wants the result.
 * The other three symbols you should be familiar with from the lectures:
 - The triangle with the circle in the output is a not-gate (inverter).
 - The D-shaped port is an and-gate.
 - The "rocket"-shaped port is an or-gate.


 All other components are available from the main toolbox (below the “File” menu).

### Wires


![Logisim circuit]({{site.baseurl}}/labs/07/circuit.png)

In the circuit above:
 * Lines (wires) have different colors.
   - **<span style="color: #00d200">Bright green wires</span>** are "on" (true, or 1).
   - **<span style="color: #006400">Dull green wires</span>** are "off" (false, or 0).
   - **<span style="color: #2828ff">Blue wires</span>** are disconnected wires, some of these may be ignored, as long as they are purposefully unused.
   - **<span style="color: #c00000">Red wires</span>** indicate an error, such as two conflicting outputs connected, or undefined values. **You always want to correct issues leading to red wires!**


### Tips

Here are a few useful tips when building circuits:
 * Clicking and dragging creates wires.
   - The point where you start the click and where you let go of the click, determines where the wire connects to other things.
   - If for example, you click then drag the mouse over another wire, the two wires will not be joined.
   - If you click to draw a wire, then let go of the mouse while it is positioned over top of an existing wire, then the new wire and existing wire will be joined.
   - Except (of course there is an except :)
     - Be careful when you drag the wire over the **end** of another wire, they may connect!
   - Green dots show where wires connect to other wires.
 * To move segments of wires, you may find Alt-Click (Not sure about Apple PCs :) useful.
   - For complicated circuits, this can help you clean up a messy design. But if you’re not careful, it can also complicate a simple one!
   - As usual, undo is your friend and is just a Ctrl-Z away.
 * You can easily rotate circuit components.
   - For example, when you add an AND gate to a circuit, it faces "east" by default (that is, the input comes from the left side and the output is on the right side).
   - Clicking on the AND gate lets you change some of its properties. - Changing the "facing" property rotates the gate. You can also click on a gate and use the up/down/left/right arrow keys to rotate it.
   - Port labels can also be placed in different relative positions
 * **Optical illusion:** Sometimes, a wire looks like it is connected to a component, but it really is not.
   - Zoom-in on the component to ensure that the wire is connected to the component’s pin.
   - The zoom control is in the lower-left-hand corner of Logisim’s window. (It took me 3 minutes to figure out how to zoom :/)
 * Multi-bit input and output pins are easily confused.
 - To check a pin component, examine the output property in the pin component’s attribute table.
 - You may also notice that input pins have square corners and output pins have rounded corners.
 * Gates have a size property (useful only for gates with more than 3 inputs).
 - Left click an existing gate and change its size.
 * Gates also have a number-of-inputs property to set how many inputs they can use.
 * If you get an "oscillation apparent" error, it indicates that you are in some way creating an invalid "loop" of wires.
   - For example, the output of a gate may indirectly loop back onto the
same gate, causing the gate to keep switching (oscillating) between outputting 1 or 0.
   - You should never get this error if you are doing things properly.
 * If you are still having an unexplained problem after considering the tips above, save your file, and then try to resolve the problem by restarting Logisim.

{:.question}
| **B.1: Now that you know all about the basic functionality of Logisim, create a one-bit adder, basing your work on the circuit design shown below. Make sure the names of the input and output pins are the same as in the circuit below.**

## Part C: Adder analysis (2 pts)

The circuit that you built in Part B implements the following Boolean equations, which are the Boolean equations for a one-bit adder:



<script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/latest.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML' async></script>



$$ S=\overline{AB}C_\texttt{in} + \overline{A}B\overline{C_\texttt{in}} + A\overline{BC_\texttt{in}} + ABC_\texttt{in} $$

$$ C_\texttt{out}=AC_\texttt{in}+BC_\texttt{in} + AB $$




For each combination of inputs $$A$$, $$B$$, and $$C_\texttt{in}$$, determine  the  outputs  of each AND gate A1-A11, each OR gate O1-O5, and the final outputs S and $$C_\texttt{out}$$, according to the diagram on the previous page.

By changing the values of the input pins, observe the behaviour of your circuit and fill out the following truth table.
**Remember:** A truth table describes the behaviour of a circuit given all possible inputs.

### Collaboration Policy

You **may** work with one other person on your lab.
They may be from the other recitation, but must be from my CS447 lecture section.
You both must add a note to your written submission (at the top, very legibly) indicating who you are working with.
You both **must** submit your own individual lab submission, but may collaborate directly on the answer.

### Submission

For parts A, B and C you should submit one file named `dww9_lab7a.txt/docx`, `dww9_lab7b.circ`, and `dww9_lab7c.txt/docx` respectively. **Make sure you replace `dww9` with your own pitt username.**
Put all files into a `.zip` file with the name `dww9_lab7.zip`, again using your own pitt username (you'd be surprised) and submit to the `cs447-submissions` Box folder I have shared with you.
Your Box folder (you have 50GB!) is accessible through <http://my.pitt.edu>.
When you see your file within the shared folder, you know you have uploaded it successfully.
If you would like to resubmit, you can copy the file in again.
Let me know immediately if there are any problems submitting your work.
