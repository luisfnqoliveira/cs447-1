<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>

<p>Go <a href="/schedule">here</a> for the day to day schedule and lecture materials.</p>

<h2 id="grades">Grades</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>20%</strong> Labs (Around one a week, lowest two dropped. (I think it will be 12 labs))</li>
  <li><strong>30%</strong> Projects (Two projects: 15% each; One MIPS, One Logisim)</li>
  <li><strong>15%</strong> Midterm One</li>
  <li><strong>15%</strong> Midterm Two</li>
  <li><strong>20%</strong> Final (semi-cumulative)</li>
</ul>

<p>You may ask to have an exam, project or lab regraded. However, the entire exam, project or lab will be regraded. This may or may not result in a grade change, either up or down. To have an assignment regraded, you must hand in the item with a typewritten paragraph explaining what was not graded correctly. You must ask for the regrading by the next class period after the project, lab, or exam was returned. There will be no exceptions to this requirement.</p>

<h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2>

<p>Computer Organization and Design - The Hardware/Software Interface, John Hennessy and David Patterson, FIFTH EDITION, Morgan Kaufmann.</p>

<p>I don’t really care about the book as far as it is needed for teaching the concepts, and I’ll say that the book is not <em>actually</em> required and is more of a supplemental material for furthering your understanding and knowledge.</p>

<p>As always, you can find this textbook in most libraries and definitely will be reserved in Hillman.</p>

<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>

<p>There will be two midterm exams and one cumulative final.
You are responsible for looking at the schedule and hearing announcements about the scheduling of all exams.
The tentative dates of the exams are located on the schedule page and are subject to change.
Exams are closed book and an individual effort.</p>

<p>You must take all exams in the lecture session for which you are registered!</p>

<p>Specific instructions for each exam will be posted at a closer date.</p>

<h2 id="labs">Labs</h2>

<p>Labs will be conducted during recitation. The lab assignments will be distributed in recitation and turned in electronically by the due date stated on the lab. A weekly short quiz will also be given in lab. More information about the labs and quizzes will be given in the first recitation. A solution will be posted on the TA’s web site for each lab and quiz within one to two weeks of the due date.</p>

<p>The lowest two lab grades will be dropped (i.e., you can turn in two labs without penalty).</p>

<p>You are allowed to collaborate with a partner in the lab unless noted otherwise. However, each person must turn in their own copy of the lab, with the name of their partner. Both names (your name and your partner’s name) must appear on the assignment.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>There will be two projects for this course.
One will be a programming project requiring the writing of a significant assembly program.
The target will be between 100 and 300 lines of code, maybe a little more or a little less depending on your design or the requirements.
The programming, including labs, will be using the MARS MIPS simulator.</p>

<p>The second project is oriented around logic design.
You will create a (simple) processor for a particular instruction set (to be discussed).
This design will be implemented using a simulator tool called Logisim.
This tool, thankfully, helpfully gives us a lot of nice building blocks so we aren’t reinventing fire, etc, and everything else.</p>

<p>The projects will be graded on a rubric by your TA or class grader.
The rubric will reflect the posted requirements and goal of the project.
Partial credit will be rewarded based on the rubric and the overall requirements of the project.</p>

<p>Solutions will not be provided for any project.</p>

<p>You are responsible for attending lectures and recitations in order to receive any guidance or hints given generally to the class (even if they do not get posted)</p>

<p>TAs and myself will be available during posted office hours (and by request, otherwise) to provide assistance.</p>

<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>

<p>You should come to class!
First off, I make sure to explore the relevance of assembly and computer architectures in everyday life.
The exploration of the algorithms and techniques is fairly vital for success on exams and projects.
Also, I think I’m a good teacher (you can disagree in the OMETs, which you need to attend class to participate in!)</p>

<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, as part of the overall university policy and culture, collaboration is <strong>not allowed</strong> in any form or any project or exam, unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p>This includes the sharing of materials, past materials, materials from other sections of this class. The only exception is if <strong>you</strong> wrote the material (because you are repeating the class).</p>

<p>Any use of material that is not your own constitutes as collaboration, which informally is considered cheating, and is then a violation of this policy.
Cheating will earn you a 0 on the assignment/exam on the first offense. You will <strong>fail the course</strong> on the second offense.</p>

<p>If you have any doubts about what is “cheating”, ask the instructor for clarification before you do it. The instructor will make the final determination of what is considered cheating.</p>

<p>You are generally allowed to talk about projects and share insight (and you should!) You cannot write any part of another student’s assignment or review another student’s logic design.</p>

<h2 id="conduct-policy">Conduct Policy</h2>

<p>No harassment of any kind is allowed.
No jokes or comments about sex, gender, race, ethnicity, or religion will be tolerated in any classroom setting.
This includes lectures, recitations, and any online space established for the course.
Please refer to the <a href="https://www.titleix.pitt.edu/">Title IX Office</a> for more policy information any contact information in case of any discrimination or harassment.</p>

<h2 id="lateearly-policy">Late/Early Policy</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Illness and other compelling reasons</strong>: A late assignment (exam or project) with a valid excuse according to University rules, such as an extended illness or hospitalization, will be accepted up to one week late without a penalty. Arrangements must be made in advance when possible; written documentation of the compelling reason must be provided.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Voluntary late projects</strong>: A project may be turned in late for any reason, but it will be penalized by 20% for each day it is late.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Voluntary late labs</strong>: Because the occassional missed lab can be missed without penalty since the lowest two lab scores are dropped, voluntary late labs will not be accepted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be no early exams. Make up exams must be pre-approved. No make up exams will be given that do not meet University rules and have proper (written) documentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All make up work (exams, projects) must be completed within one week of the original assignment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under extraordinary circumstances, such as an extended multi-week illness, other accommodations can be made for the course and this policy can be amended to permit some flexibility for completing the missed work.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes-for-students">Notes for Students</h2>

<h3 id="disability-resources-and-services">Disability Resources and Services</h3>

<p>If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact the <a href="https://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/drs/">Office of Disability Resources and Services</a> (DRS), 140 William Pitt Union (412-648-7890) (TTY 412-383-7355), as soon as possible in the term. They will verify your disability and determine reasonable accommodations for this course.</p>

<h3 id="file-backups">File Backups</h3>

<p>It is your responsibility to backup your work regularly. Please consider using reliable and multiple ways to protect your files! I.e.: Please make backups, and backups of your backups, and… (you get the point!) The University offers space that you can use for backups through Box, if you like. Both Google Drive and Dropbox have free tiers that also work well. No extensions for assignments will be approved due to failed laptops, hard drive crashes, lost USB drives, or other calamities that lead to lost or corrupted data. Per the policy on voluntary late assignments, you may turn in a project up to five days late (with a penalty), which should give sufficient time to recover a lost/corrupted project.</p>
